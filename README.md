# Bridge Analyzer

This is the fun project involving ~~procedurally generating~~ (WIP) trusses as a bridge which are then verified with finite-element analysis.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Two versions currently exist (merging in progress):
to run Maximo/Artem's version, do `python main.py`;
to run Stephen's version, do `./cooler.py` (or `.\cooler.py` on Windows).
